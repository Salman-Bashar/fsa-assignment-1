# Assignment 1 Implementation

## Requirements

Please select one or many algorithm ideas from the below list and create a rest api out of it -

- We have a function that can take two arguments called start and end. Both arguments will be a valid integer number. The function will return a random value in the given range.
- We have a function that can generate a fake person profile including first name, last name, email, avatar, age and address. User can pass an array of selected properties and it will return a person object containing only given properties. Ex: generatePerson([’firstName’, ‘lastName’, ‘email’])
- We have a function that can accept a string as an argument and return an object containing the number of letters, number of symbols and number of numeric characters.

N.B.: You must have to keep business logic and API logic separate.
